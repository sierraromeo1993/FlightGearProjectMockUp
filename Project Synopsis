Project Synopsis/File Structure/ Implementation of Main Files


PROJECT SYNOPSIS : In our project the user can see a simulation of a flight in a Cessna 172 rotor plane and see active data attributes of the given flight whether through current position of Joystick Rudder, Throttle . General Data sets of Height, Speed, Yaw, current Direction, Roll, and Pitch of plane while in flight. We also allow our user to see and understand different correlation and regression factors between different data attributes during the flight.

File Structure :

Implementation of Main Files :
                              
                              InfoServer : A class which takes care of accessing and handling data from FlightGear API
                              
                              FileParser : A function which takes a CSV file and parses it to be used in the 
                                          Application 
                             
                              PanelModel : The Business Logic of the Panel implementation  and and all "first" layer 
                                           components of the application
                             
                              GraphModel : The Business Logic of the Graph implementation and and all "second" layer 
                                           components of the application

                              PanelViewModel : The ViewModel of Panel implementation 

                              GraphViewModel : The ViewModel of the Graph implementation

                              MasterViewModel : The Master Component which runs all other ViewModels conglomerate
                                                into, basically the entire application center onto this component.

                              PanelView :  The View of the Panel , basically the visual implementation of all 
                                           first layer components
                             
                              GraphWindow : The View of the  Graph , allows user to view all second "layer" 
                                            components.
